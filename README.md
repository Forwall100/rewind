## Features üöÄ

- **Automatic screen capture**: Takes screenshots at a set frequency.
- **Text Recognition**: Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from screenshots.
- **Text Search**: Saves screenshots and extracted text in the SQLite database.
- **Console Application**: Allows you to search by screenshots in the console.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install Rewind on Arch Linux, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Forwall100/rewind.git
    cd rewind
    ```

2. **Run the installation script:**

    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

    This script will execute:
    - Installation of necessary dependencies.
    - Build and install the package.
    - Enabling and launching the Rewind service to create screenshots.

## Usage üéÆ

### Launch

To launch the Rewind client application, run:

```bash
rewind
```

This will open a console application where you can search for screenshots by text or the time they were created.

### Navigation in the client interface

- **Search**: Enter your query and use the arrows to select the desired screenshot.
- **Timeline Mode**: Press `Tab` to switch the timeline mode. Use the left and right arrows to navigate through different timestamps.
- **Open Image**: Press `Enter` to open the selected screenshot.
- **Exit**: Press `Esc` to exit the application.

## Data storage üíæ

Rewind stores its data in the SQLite database located at the path `~/.config/rewind/screenshots.db`. Screenshots are saved as binary data, and the text extracted from them is saved as plain text. No security)))

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The configuration file is located at the path `~/.config/rewind/config.yaml'. You can configure the following settings:

- **languages**: Languages for text recognition. The default is `eng+rus'. Multiple languages are indicated by a '+'.
- **max_db_size_mb**: The maximum size of the database in megabytes. The default is `20000`.
-**screenshot_period_sec**: The period between screenshots in seconds. The default is `30`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Restart systemd service ```rewind-screenshot.service``` to make the config changes take effect

### Example of `config.yaml`

```yaml
languages: "eng+rus"
max_db_size_mb: 20000
screenshot_period_sec: 30
```

## Systemd Service üîÑ

The background service is managed by systemd. The service file `rewind-screenshot.service` is installed in `/usr/lib/systemd/user/`.

To manually start or stop the service, use:

```bash
systemctl --user start rewind-screenshot.service
systemctl --user stop rewind-screenshot.service
```

To enable the service when logging in:

```bash
systemctl --user enable rewind-screenshot.service
```

## Dependencies üì¶

Rewind depends on the following packages:

- `python`
- `python-pillow`
- `python-pytesseract`
- `python-yaml`
- `tesseract`
- `tesseract-data-eng`
- `tesseract-data-rus`
- `grim` (for Wayland)
- `scrot` (for X11)

These dependencies are automatically installed during the configuration process. To add new OCR languages, you need to install the appropriate tesseract-data-[langcode] packages and edit the config.

## Delete üóëÔ∏è

To remove Rewind, follow these steps:

1. **Stop and disable the service:**

    ```bash
    systemctl --user stop rewind-screenshot.service
    systemctl --user disable rewind-screenshot.service
    ```

2. **Delete the installed files:**

    ```bash
    sudo rm /usr/bin/rewind
    sudo rm /usr/lib/systemd/user/rewind-screenshot.service
    sudo rm -rf ~/.config/rewind
    ```

3. **Delete the package**

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -R rewind
    ```
